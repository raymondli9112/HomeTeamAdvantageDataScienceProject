# Home Team Advantage Data Science Project
Used exploratory data analysis and modeling to determine whether or not home team advantage had a statistically significant effect on an NBA team's win outcome.
Using Data sets sourced from kaggle, we performed exploratory data analysis on two levels: the team level and the player level. We wanted to find out if game location (home or away) would have a significant effect on players and the teams. 

Data sets were sourced from kaggle from this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games?select=games.csv
The data contains NBA data from the 2003 to 2020 (most recent) season. 

1. Exploratory data analysis and modeling code can be found in the "An In-Depth Look at Home Court Advantage - NBA.ipynb" ipynb file. 
2. Our report is labeled as "Data Science Programming Report" and is in a pdf file format. 
3. Our slide deck, labeled as "NBA Modeling-5" is also in a pdf file format. 

Enjoy!
